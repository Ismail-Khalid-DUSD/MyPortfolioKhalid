            <strong>LifeSavers:</strong> December 2025 - Computer Science Essentials                                                    This project was the semester final for the highschool computer science essentials class. In this app, my group of four created an app on MIT app inventor in which one can access information and steps on what to do in certain emergencies including a fire, an earthquake, a tornado, a hurricane, and an intruder. My group switched between working on different parts of the code, design view, and slideshow throughout day we got to work. All in all, we created a project that required teamwork and cooperation, and inspired determination and constancy. We all had a fun time and it was a great learning experience for all of us.

            <strong>Project Two:</strong> This project was the final assignment in Unit 1 of the highschool computer science essentials class. In this app, Me an my partner recreated the famous game Flappy Bird and named it Birdy Flap. The object of the game is to score as many points as you can. In the game, one can switch the color of the character to colors like Black, Gray, Purple, Red, and Blue. You can aslo pause and reset the game through a button. Every class period, my partner and I switched frequently between documenting the project and actually coding it. This project required teamwork and caused us to frequently communicate and help each other out. This pair programming method proved to be very effecient as we got done with the project very quickly and learned to communicate more effeciently.
